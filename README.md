- (#sfxFloat). Update setSfx() to reflect state on #sfxFloat so the visible control always mirrors the current audio setting. No functional changes elsewhere.

- Updated renderPostGameContent() to only update #playerStats and #leaderboard, keeping Play Again / Change Mode / Feedback buttons intact.
- Personalized stats: show "Your name" instead of generic "User"; rank shown when GAS matches username.
- Normalized username handling (trim) before submit/fetch so rank displays correctly; default to Guest if blank.
- CSS cleanup: removed duplicate survey/login blocks; removed unused leaderboardBlock ul/li rules. Table (.lbTable) styles finalized.

### v9.9.8

- Google Apps Script leaderboard now filters by mode; only top 5 scores from the same mode are shown (Classic / Challenge / Mood).
- Frontend getLeaderboard() passes current mode to GAS so results are mode-specific.
- Post-game stats block updated: align left for easier reading.
- Changed label from "Your name" to "Name" for cleaner presentation.

### v10.0.3

- Removed random palette; all modes now teal=score, red=penalty.

- Simplified tint logic (_tint set once at spawn, reused in draw).

### v10.0.5
- Mood trick bubbles
- Mood mode now spawns occasional red 'trick' bubbles (MOOD_TRICK_RATE), same teal/red scheme.
- spawnBubble() sets b.kind for Challenge and Mood; draw/score already use b.kind.

### v10.0.6
- SFX + Mood fixes
- SFX floater: single handle (__sfxBtn), init/resume audio, preview pop.
- Mood loader: show ‚Üí await models/camera ‚Üí hide; start sampler when frames ready.
- Post-game: ‚ÄúYour name‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúName‚Äù.

### v10.0.7
- Classic SFX + Mood rank
- Classic: restored pop sound using `maybePop()` (sound-only), preserving Classic scoring and combo rules.
- Mood: rank parsing hardened (numeric coercion) so rank no longer shows ‚Äú‚Äì‚Äù when the backend returns a string.

### v10.0.8
- Classic ‚ÄúChange Mode‚Äù guard
- Prevent Classic from auto-restarting when ‚ÄúChange Mode‚Äù is pressed.
- `showModePicker()` now freezes gameplay during selection and cancels Classic auto-start timers.
- `openClassicOpts()` and `restart()` honor a picking guard to avoid unintended starts.

### v10.0.9
- Classic: always show Timed/Relax picker (no auto-start).
- Login: saved name pre-fills; ‚ÄúUse previous name‚Äù button logs in directly.

### v10.1.0
- Splash audio fix
- AudioContext is now resumed immediately inside the splash tap/click handler (before timeouts),
  eliminating Chrome‚Äôs autoplay warnings. (minor)

### v10.1.1
- Accuracy fix ‚Äî removed duplicate input handlers (mousePressed/touchStarted) and now compute accuracy using all pops, so displayed accuracy matches actual clicks. (minor)

### v10.1.2
- Leaderboard guard ‚Äî debounce leaderboard fetches (5s) and show a fallback message if the proxy returns 429/failed, preventing blank summaries. (minor)
