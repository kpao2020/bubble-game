Added "Feedback" button to Post-game modal (after-game feedback). Feedback (before) is stored locally and attached to the next run payload. Feedback (after) is captured via modal and included in the run payload. Changed submission flow: endGame no longer posts immediately. A run is posted exactly once per round when the player chooses Play Again, Change Mode, or saves post-game feedback. Introduced submitRunOnce() guard and runSubmitted flag.
### v9.0.2
- Feedback safeguards + always-log option captured into feedbackAfter before posting. Prevents accidental loss of feedback if the player skips Save. Adopted "Option 2": Close (‚úñ) on the Post-game modal now also triggers submitRunOnce(), so every finished round is logged. Added safeguard: if the Feedback modal is open with unsaved text when the player taps Play Again / Change Mode / Close, that text is auto Guard logic still ensures only one POST per round (no duplicates).
### v9.1.0
- ‚Äúbio‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúmood‚Äù refactor (no behavior change) Replaced all remaining bio* ids/selectors/keys with mood* across HTML/CSS/JS. Fixed isMoodMode() to check 'mood' (was 'bio') so Mood features always run. Renamed consent helpers and modal ids to moodConsent*; added one-time localStorage migration. Renamed top-bar chip id to #moodChip and updated JS to use it. (Optional) Renamed sampleBio() ‚Üí sampleMood() and console tags ‚Äú[bio]‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äú[mood]‚Äù.
### v9.1.1
- fix comment bio -> mood on certain spots
### v9.2.0
- Pre- and Post-game surveys, JSON in single cell Added 2 baseline (pre-game) questions: stress level + mood. Added 4 multiple choice + 1 short answer survey after each round. Both stored as JSON strings in feedbackBefore / feedbackAfter. Replaces old free-text feedback field. Single-POST flow preserved via submitRunOnce(); no duplicate rows.
### v9.2.1
- Post-game feedback polish (mobile + UX) After saving post-game feedback: show ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù state, disable the Feedback button, and prevent reopening for the same round. Clear answers for the next round automatically. Compact mobile layout for post-game survey (2-column choices, larger tap targets).
### v9.2.2
- Login tidy + post-game layout + scrollable survey Login: shorter username field; OK + Feedback side-by-side; clearer note + separate disclaimer. Pre-game Feedback: when saved, lock button (no ‚Äúthank you‚Äù modal). Post-game: Feedback moved to its own row; distinct colors on all three buttons. Feedback modal: header/footer fixed; questions area scrolls on mobile; hover/active states kept.
### v9.2.3
- Fix duplicate usernameInput reference in setup(); reuse single const (no functional change). Login OK wiring ‚Äî replaced legacy #submitUsername with #loginOkBtn to match HTML; click handler now attaches correctly.
### v9.2.4
- Fix mismatch submitRun and submitRunOnce
### v9.2.5
- Feedback textarea id aligned to #postQ5 (was #feedbackText) so post-game comments are captured.
### v9.2.6
- ‚Äî Troubleshooting begins...
### v9.2.7
- Stabilize draw() ‚Äî guard bubble loop (null-safe + try/catch) so a bad frame doesn‚Äôt black-screen.
### v9.2.8
- Remove undefined onLoginSave; bind loginOkBtn directly to showLoginScreen(playerDeviceId).
### v9.2.9

### v9.2.11
- Remove dead DOM refs ‚Äî delete #modeSelect disables in endGame() and restart().
### v9.2.12
- Optimize code in sketch.js style.css and index.html
### v9.3.0
- Optimized Mood mode (lazy-load face-api, lighter models) Balanced gameplay: fewer bubbles per mode, size-based scoring, miss-streak easing
### v9.3.1
- Minor UI cleanup - Removed legacy restartBtn (HTML, CSS, JS) since Post-game modal fully replaces it. Login screen: moved OK + Feedback buttons into their own row (right-aligned) for clearer layout.
### v9.3.2
- UI readability improvements Increased button text and emoji/icon size for better visibility. Adjusted button background colors for stronger contrast with text. Ensured higher legibility across login, mode picker, and post-game buttons.
### v9.4
- Login UX overhaul ‚Äî type immediately, inline ‚ÄúSaving‚Ä¶‚Äù (no extra prompt), sleek pill OK button with spinner, animated helper text (fade + shake on errors), glassy login card + soft gradient backdrop, autofocus + Enter-to-submit, auto-select on first focus, and smooth fade-out into Mode Picker.
### v9.5
- Login card micro pop-in (scale + fade) on open for a smoother, modern feel.
### v9.6
- Single-helper copy + consistent ‚Äúusername‚Äù ‚Äî clear which username will be used if you typed while device data loads.
### v9.6.1
- Remove duplicate helper line in index.html
### v9.7
- Auto-suggest on empty submit ‚Äî if no username is typed, we fill with prior profile or Player-XXXXXX, update helper, and refocus the input so the user can confirm or edit quickly.
### v9.8
- Auto dark-mode theming for login and splash using `prefers-color-scheme`. Updates the glassy login card, backdrop, input, and helper text colors for dark backgrounds. Splash screen gets a darker gradient and matching card styling. Pure CSS ‚Äî no changes to HTML or JS.
### v9.9
- Add procedural bubble-pop SFX (WebAudio) with top-bar toggle (default muted) and fix dark-mode splash CTA contrast.
### v9.9.1
- WebAudio SFX (muted by default) + first-tap confirmation pop; dark-mode splash CTA contrast; SFX toggle in header.
### v9.9.2
- Splash ‚ÄúStart‚Äù card acts as a single teal CTA (click/tap/Enter/Space); first tap plays a confirmation pop to init WebAudio; Mode Picker tiles unchanged. (minor)
### v9.9.3
- Unmuted SFX by default with first-tap confirm pop; add bottom-left floating sound toggle; canvas ignores taps on it. (minor)
### v9.9.4
- Remove duplicate top-bar sound button (#sfxBtn) next to Mode chip; keep bottom-left floating SFX toggle (#sfxFloat). Update setSfx() to reflect state on #sfxFloat so the visible control always mirrors the current audio setting. No functional changes elsewhere.
### v9.9.5
- Replace Mode Picker small icon buttons with full-width teal bar buttons. Reorder as Mood, Challenge, Classic. Buttons are responsive, stretch to container width, adjust height for icon+text, and keep consistent teal styling.
### v9.9.6
- GAS: add GET ?action=leaderboard (limit|n, username) over Runs; sort by score desc, accuracy desc, newest. Return {ok,scores[],me:{rank}}. In doPost, accept "submitRun" as alias for "run". Reuse existing Runs tab; no new sheet. Worker: normalize ?limit to ?n for backward-compat with GAS top handler. Keep CORS allowlist and POST secret append unchanged. No other behavioral changes; leaderboard and submitRun calls are forwarded verbatim.
### v9.9.7
- Post-game polish Removed legacy "Game Over / Score" overlay (#center); post-game modal is now the single source of round summary. Updated renderPostGameContent() to only update #playerStats and #leaderboard, keeping Play Again / Change Mode / Feedback buttons intact. Personalized stats: show "Your name" instead of generic "User"; rank shown when GAS matches username. Normalized username handling (trim) before submit/fetch so rank displays correctly; default to Guest if blank. CSS cleanup: removed duplicate survey/login blocks; removed unused leaderboardBlock ul/li rules. Table (.lbTable) styles finalized.
### v9.9.8
- Leaderboard by mode + UI polish Google Apps Script leaderboard now filters by mode; only top 5 scores from the same mode are shown (Classic / Challenge / Mood). Frontend getLeaderboard() passes current mode to GAS so results are mode-specific. Post-game stats block updated: align left for easier reading. Changed label from "Your name" to "Name" for cleaner presentation. Added placeholder text inside Post-game modal while stats + leaderboard are loading, so players see immediate feedback instead of a blank modal.
### v10.0.0
- Classic variants Step 2: startClassicRound(), buildClassicBoard() (static grid), timed/relax end checks in draw()
### v10.0.1
- Challenge tuning Combo multiplier: after 5 hits ‚Üí x1.5, after 10 hits ‚Üí x2.0; reset on miss. On-screen badge shows current combo state. Updated scoring in handlePop() to apply multiplier (no bonus on trick bubbles).
### v10.0.2
- Classic polish Reduce red penalty (‚àí2 default; tweakable). End when all teal bubbles are popped; reds no longer block game end.
### v10.0.3
- Timer + Audio polish Classic Timed: reset timer to 60s on Play Again (re-sets classicDeadline in restart()). AudioContext: resume on first user gesture (global pointer/key listener) to satisfy Chrome autoplay policy.
### v10.0.4
- Color unification + cleanup Removed random palette; all modes now teal=score, red=penalty. Replaced b.red / b._type with b.kind ('normal' | 'trick'). Simplified tint logic (_tint set once at spawn, reused in draw).
### v10.0.5
- Mood trick bubbles Mood mode now spawns occasional red 'trick' bubbles (MOOD_TRICK_RATE), same teal/red scheme. spawnBubble() sets b.kind for Challenge and Mood; draw/score already use b.kind.
### v10.0.6
- SFX + Mood fixes SFX floater: single handle (__sfxBtn), init/resume audio, preview pop. Mood loader: show ‚Üí await models/camera ‚Üí hide; start sampler when frames ready. Post-game: ‚ÄúYour name‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúName‚Äù.
### v10.0.7
- Classic SFX + Mood rank Classic: restored pop sound using `maybePop()` (sound-only), preserving Classic scoring and combo rules. Mood: rank parsing hardened (numeric coercion) so rank no longer shows ‚Äú‚Äì‚Äù when the backend returns a string.
### v10.0.8
- Classic ‚ÄúChange Mode‚Äù guard Prevent Classic from auto-restarting when ‚ÄúChange Mode‚Äù is pressed. `showModePicker()` now freezes gameplay during selection and cancels Classic auto-start timers. `openClassicOpts()` and `restart()` honor a picking guard to avoid unintended starts.
### v10.0.9
- Classic: always show Timed/Relax picker (no auto-start). Login: saved name pre-fills; ‚ÄúUse previous name‚Äù button logs in directly.
### v10.1.0
- Splash audio fix AudioContext is now resumed immediately inside the splash tap/click handler (before timeouts), eliminating Chrome‚Äôs autoplay warnings. (minor)
### v10.1.1
- Accuracy fix ‚Äî removed duplicate input handlers (mousePressed/touchStarted) and now compute accuracy using all pops, so displayed accuracy matches actual clicks. (minor)
### v10.1.2
- Leaderboard guard ‚Äî debounce leaderboard fetches (5s) and show a fallback message if the proxy returns 429/failed, preventing blank summaries. (minor)
### v10.1.3
- Added bubble pop animations (shrink, fade, burst) with score flyout above bubble.
### v10.1.4
- Added pre-game **3-2-1-GO!** countdown before each round. Countdown pauses gameplay until finished, preventing early pops.
### v10.1.5
- Loading overlay polish: progress bar now fills step-by-step and reaches 100% before hiding. Ensures smoother transition into countdown and gameplay.
### v10.1.6
- Fix loading overlay (lingers 300 ms at 100%), hoist `loading` var (no ReferenceError), ensure Mood/Challenge spawn bubbles, and add 3 s fail-safe for iOS incognito dark-screen bug. (minor)
### v10.1.7
- Countdown polish ‚Äî removed blank gap after loading (overlay hides after ‚Äú3‚Äù shows), and added 3-2-1-GO before Play Again restarts. (minor)
### v10.1.8
- Mood mode polish ‚Äî fixed premature overlay hide at ~60%, now shows 100% until first sample, overlay disappears exactly with ‚Äú3‚Äù so no blank gap before countdown. (minor)
### v10.1.9
- Fix Mode Picker ‚Äî Mood button on iOS no longer triggers Challenge; handler updated to allow Mood selection multiple times per session. (minor)
### v10.2.0
- Removed floating sound button (FAB).  
- Added ‚Äúüîä Sound on‚Äù checkbox in Mode Picker and Post-game modal.  
- Sound preference is stored in localStorage and applied each round via setSfx(). (minor)
### v10.3.0
- Adjust Mood Mode scoring system with higher multiplier.
- Adjust Mood Mode detection and indication system.
- Adjust Mood Mode popping animation.
### v10.3.1
- Pre-round polish ‚Äî added short teal ‚ÄúGet Ready‚Ä¶‚Äù fade-in before 3-2-1 countdown on Play Again / Change Mode; clears previous game screen for a cleaner transition.
### v10.3.2
- UI polish ‚Äî narrowed top-bar Quit button on mobile; adjusted bubble spawn Y-range to stay clear of top bar.
### v10.3.3
- Mobile tweak ‚Äî compact top-bar ‚ÄúQuit‚Äù button on iPhone-width screens (‚â§430px) to prevent overflow.
### v10.3.4
- Top-bar layout ‚Äî moved ‚ÄúQuit‚Äù into the center cluster (next to Mood chip) to keep Mode chip + Camera stable on the right; added phone-specific compact styling.
### v10.3.5
- Top-bar & post-game polish ‚Äî Classic Relax grid respects safe top (no bubbles under header); Quit moved to center and compact on phones; Mode chip no longer overflows; post-game actions wrap to 2√ó2 on small screens.
### v10.3.6
- Classic options rename ‚Äî ‚ÄúRelax‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúüåø Endless Zen Mode‚Äù; ‚ÄúTimed‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äú‚è±Ô∏è 60-Second Sprint‚Äù (labels only; logic unchanged).
### v10.3.7
- Endless Classic ‚Äî Relax is now truly non-stop: when all teal bubbles are cleared, a fresh board spawns automatically and the round continues until you tap Quit (Timed unchanged).
### v10.3.8
- UX & UI overhaul ‚Äî added top-bar Quit button (visible in Relax/Endless), compact on phones; fixed bubbles spawning under top bar; centered Quit beside Mood chip without pushing Mode chip off-screen; ensured post-game buttons wrap neatly on small screens. 
- Classic updates ‚Äî Relax renamed **üåø Endless Zen Mode**, Timed renamed **‚è±Ô∏è 60-Second Sprint** and reordered so Endless appears first. Relax is now truly endless, automatically refilling boards until the player quits. 
- Mode naming ‚Äî UI-only rename: **Classic ‚Üí Zen**, **Challenge ‚Üí Focus**, **Mood ‚Üí Emotion** (IDs unchanged; internal logic intact).
### v10.4.0
- Stabilizes Zen (Classic) mode flow: Options modal always shows, countdown gates gameplay, and the top bar only appears when a round actually starts. Also prevents ‚Äúdark screen‚Äù by adding a safe background fallback.
### v10.4.1
- Leaderboard redesign ‚Äî removed Mode column, retained Accuracy.  
  - Shows only Rank, Name, Score, and Accuracy.  
  - Player‚Äôs own row flashes teal if within Top 5.  
  - If player ranks outside Top 5, a 6th highlighted ‚ÄúYou‚Äù row appears beneath the leaderboard.  
- Modal polish ‚Äî replaced ‚ÄúClose‚Äù button with **Quit** for clearer exit intent.  
- Helper & consent copy refresh ‚Äî renamed all remaining *Mood* references to **Emotion** to match UI display names (Zen / Focus / Emotion).  
- Added groundwork for ‚ÄúPlayer Stats‚Äù screen (session summary of last 5 games with average / high score).  
### v10.5.0
- Post-game UX fixes ‚Äî guaranteed 3‚Äì2 action layout on wide screens (2 columns on small); no player stats shown on the leaderboard.
- Quit button reliability ‚Äî automatically restored after **Play Again** and **Change Mode** across Zen/Endless and other modes.
- Stats modal flow ‚Äî pressing **Close** returns to the post-game screen instead of leaving the UI blank.
- Leaderboard polish ‚Äî shows only **Rank / Name / Score / Acc**; your row flashes teal when in Top 5, or appears as a 6th highlighted row if outside Top 5.
- Copy cleanup ‚Äî helper text uses the new mode display names (Zen / Focus / Emotion); ‚ÄúRound complete‚Äù title remains static.
